            <span class="highlight">Hello everyone!</span><br>
            I recently attended the <span class="highlight">Vket Real 2024 Winter</span> event and it was an absolute blast!<br>
            From the incredible booths to the amazing community interactions, everything was just perfect.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-content">
            I got to explore a plethora of booths.<br>
            Each booth was a unique experience, Showcasing everything from realistic reproductions of common VRChat objects to booths where you could create an avatar on the spot or 3D scan yourself into a digital avatar. <br>
            I was particularly impressed by the booth from <span class="highlight">HIKKY Company</span>. <br>
            <img src="/images/vket-002.jpg" alt="Vket Event" class="blog-image">
            There was a booth to create a VRM that could be completed on the web.<br>
            <img src="/images/Avatar-Maker-ss.png" alt="Avatar Maker" class="blog-image">
            <span class="highlight">Don't be suprised yet.</span><br>
            VRChat users will be pleased. The file size of the created VRM is quite small, "Medium".<br>
            This is the rank that VRChat users struggle to achieve. (Obviously, as with other avatar creation software, there are also items to set fine details.)<br>
            To summarize, this service is quite commendable in that it can be created on the web,<br>
            whitch saves time and effort, allows even new users to quickly create their own personalities,<br>
            and file size of VRM is small.

            Overall, Vket Real was an unforgettable experience. If you ever get the chance to attend, I highly recommend it. It's a great way to immerse yourself in the latest VR innovations and meet some amazing people.

            Looking forward to the next event!
